# strike-placeholders

**Note: this was made in one evening. Not a great example and still a bit laggy.**

Quickly made simple React app + NodeJS backend with Redis to display placeholders.

Use `/sprac placeholders` on your server with StrikePractice 3.3.2+!



## Development

This was very quickly put up and you probably don't want to use it anywhere else.

Anyway, `bash start-dev.sh` to start the Dockerized development environment.
